== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find my AdSense Publisher ID? =

To display ads from Google AdSense it is required to enter your AdSense Publisher ID. Your ID can be found in your [AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/) panel in the "Settings" under "Account Information". It looks like this: pub-4268725654361605 - [Help](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/105516)

= How do I use the shortcodes? =

Simply click one of the added shortcode buttons in the visual post editor. 'Disable AdSense', will block ads for the post completely. 'Start AdSense' will show ads only from that point and 'Stop AdSense' will ensure that no ads are shown after that shortcode.
